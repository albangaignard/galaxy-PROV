# galaxy-PROV [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/albangaignard/galaxy-ld.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/albangaignard/galaxy-ld)
## Synopsis
**galaxy-PROV** is a tool dedicated to the generation of provenance graphs (RDF, PROV-O ontology) based on Galaxy user histories. The tool is currently available through a command line interface. A web-based user interface is under active development. 
## Motivations
The [Galaxy workflow environment](https://usegalaxy.org) has become very popular in the bioinformatics community. However for now, it is not possible to export provenance metadata through a standard schema and format. To address this issue and to allow the combination of multiple workflow execution traces from PROV-enabled workflow engines, we developed a loosely coupled tool aimed at exporting Galaxy user histories into PROV RDF data.
